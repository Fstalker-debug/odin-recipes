        <h2>This traditional Lebanese Tabbouleh Salad recipe is a healthy vegan Mediterranean appetizer made with bulgur, parsley, mint and chopped vegetables.</h2>
        <p>Tabbouleh is basically parsley salad. There’s technically no lettuce in it. It’s a salad made up of parsley, tomatoes, bulgur wheat, and green onions – all finely chopped and tossed with olive oil and lemon juice!</p>
        <p>Tabbouleh salad (tabouli salad) is probably the most popular Mediterranean salad, and is becoming mainstream in American grocery stores all over the country and the world, which is super cool! One thing that I’ve noticed though is that in the states, tabbouleh tends to have more bulgur than the traditional recipe calls for. The way we prepare it in Lebanon, the salad should be all about the parsley, with a hint of bulgur thrown in there.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Parsley</li>
            <li>Tomatoes</li>
            <li>Green onions</li>
            <li>Bulgur</li>
            <li>Lemon Juice </li>
            <li>Olive Oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>I like to start making the tabouleh by mixing the dressing. It’s made up of two ingredients: olive oil and lemon juice – easy enough! I whisk those together until well blended, and then let the flavor settle while I chop the vegetables.</li>
            <li>One important tip I learned though from my mother-in-law is to add the bulgur to the dressing while preparing the vegetables. This allows the bulgur to absorb some of the liquid and soften – making it easier to chew it in the salad. I used to soak it in water, but I prefer this method because there’s no risk of watering down the flavor. You’ll slowly start to see the bulgur get plump./li>
            <li>While the bulgur is soaking, prepare yourself for some mad chopping. Tabbouleh requires a lot of chopping – it’s really a labor of love.</li>
            <li>That includes a bunch (well, technically 2 bunches) of parsley, tomatoes, and green onions. Some people use a food processor to chop the parsley. But I find that it can sometimes lead to wilted chopped parsley. So I always use a large chef’s knife, and it does the trick.</li>
            <li>When you’re done chopping, transfer the bulgur and dressing mixture over the chopped vegetables and gently mix everything together.</li>
            <li>And that’s basically the tabbouleh salad recipe! And it might be the best tabbouleh recipe you’ll ever have!</li>
