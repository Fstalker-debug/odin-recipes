        <h2>This Lebanese Fattoush Salad is the quintessential salad that you’ll find at all Lebanese restaurants and throughout the Middle East. It’s a fresh and bright salad made with seasonal vegetables and topped with the iconic fried pita bread – perfect for serving with chicken tawook or beef kafta.</h2>
        <p>Fattoush is basically a Mediterranean fried bread salad that typically includes lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, radishes and fried pieces of pita bread. You’ll also typically see green peppers, green onions and parsley.</p>
        <p>In Arabic, the word “fattoush” is derived from “fatteh” which literally means “crumbs.” As you can imagine, this Fattoush Salad is basically a hodgepodge of pita bread that’s been seasoned then fried (or baked) in addition to other vegetables that are in season. For that reason, there are no rules when it comes to the vegetables you use in Fattoush! It’s a great base recipe that you can build upon and dress up how you’d like.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Lettuce</li>
            <li>Parsley</li>
            <li>Tomatoes</li>
            <li>Green peppers</li>
            <li>Cucumbers</li>
            <li>Green onions</li>
            <li>Radishes</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Coarsely chop the onion and soak it in water with a few drops of vinegar for about ½ h. You can also leave it overnight in the refrigerator. This makes the raw onion easier to digest and crispier.</li>
            <li> Prepare the vegetables. Cut the cucumbers in half lengthwise and use a spoon to scrape out the seeds. Slice them coarsely, then sprinkle with salt to let excess and possibly bitter liquids drain off. Coarsely dice the tomatoes. Chop the parsley and mint leaves. Wash the romaine lettuce, spin-dry, then tear the leaves into bite-size pieces. Place all the vegetables in a salad bowl or serving plate.</li>
            <li>Mince the garlic and put it into a small bowl. Add the oil, lemon juice, minced chili pepper, and sumac (optional). Add salt and pepper. Whisk using a fork until the vinaigrette is emulsified. Adjust the seasoning. Pour over the vegetables and toss well. Let stand 15 min.</li>
            <li>When ready to serve, grill the pita bread in a toaster, break into pieces then add them to the salad. Serve.</li>
